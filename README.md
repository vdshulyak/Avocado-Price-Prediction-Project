# Project Overview:

Our group will examine avocado prices pre and post pandemic to see the various effects of the pandemic on average prices

# Project Deliverables:
1) Understand and visualize trends in avocado prices


# Datasets to be used:
1) CSV or excel or numbers documents about 19,000 lines and 14 columns


# Tasks
1) Create dataset manually
2) Find websites with avocado prices by region, size of avocados, and growth method: Organic vs conventional



## Pandemic affected various industries across the globe. Has the pandemic affected the price of avocados? Have different types and sizes of avocados became more preffered?
## Have avocados sold in certain regions became more expensive? We believe so , perhaps in northern regions.
