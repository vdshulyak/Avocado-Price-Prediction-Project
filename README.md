# Project Overview:

Our group will examine avocado prices pre and post pandemic to see the various effects of the pandemic on average prices
- Data from Haas Avocado Board Website
https://hassavocadoboard.com/inside-hab/leadership-meetings-elections/

- Data ranges from 2015 - 2018 and 2021. No data from 2019 , 2020

- We examined avocado prices pre- and post pandemic to see the various effects of pandemic on avocado prices. 

- Hypothesis: Avocado prices are MORE expensive in 2021 due to pandemic

- Our Dataset features are regions, sizes of avocados , growing methods: organic vs conventional



# Project Deliverables:
1) Understand and visualize trends in avocado prices


# Datasets to be used:
1) CSV or excel or numbers documents about 19,000 lines and 14 columns


# Tasks
- Pulled data from Kaggle for 2015-2018
- Pulled recent data from Hass Avocado Board
- Unioned the datasets
- Removed incomplete data records using Python Pandas Library
- Corrected Datapoint Labeling for Regions
- Transformed string values into integers using Label Encoder from Sklearn
- Evaluated three ML models and picked one with higher R2 score




## Pandemic affected various industries across the globe. Has the pandemic affected the price of avocados? Have different types and sizes of avocados became more preffered?
## Have avocados sold in certain regions became more expensive? We believe so , perhaps in northern regions.
